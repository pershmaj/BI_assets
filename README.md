Well, it would be nice if you will not evaluate application design because i wanted to try element-plus library with Vue 3 and in the middle of the work found out that it's still in beta. So it was surpise for me that el-dialog component doesnt work.

    to run this app:
backend:
* ``` cd ./backend ```
* ``` npm install ```
* create config file ``` npm run create-config ```
* provide database credentials to the ``` config/config.json ```
* setup database ``` npm run setup ```, it will create database, run migrations and seeds
* ``` npm run start ```

frontend:
* ``` cd ./search-app-vue``` 
* ``` npm install ```
* ``` npm run serve ```

enjoy :)
